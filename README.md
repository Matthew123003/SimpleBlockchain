## What's a blockchain?

A _blockchain_ is a straight-forward idea: it is a data structure that is resistant modification and corruption.
It's used in **bitcoin** as mean to handle the tracking of a series of transactions in a way that is transparent to all the people sharing the data structure.

Data Structures are central to almost all computing - things like Queues and Arrays and even Databases are used throughout a system to keep its data ordered and tracked in a reliable manner. It would be pretty terrible if every time a bank's main financial system restarted, you had to type in all the customer's data.
